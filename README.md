- 👋 Hi, I’m @mycranium
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting for After Effects, Blender, and making useful utilities for my own use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to love myself. Also Extendscript (Adobe's creaky old dialect of ECMAScript 262-3. I'm always just about to start learning Python, and I've been doing a little bit of C# for Unity scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - yeah, I'm a perpetual noob so not really able to contribute much useful to anything at this point....
- 📫 How to reach me - if my email is accessible in my profile, use that. Otherwise, maybe not right now.
